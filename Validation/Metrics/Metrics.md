## Performance Metrics for Quantative Evaluation
- **we provid several widely-used metrics for ESI evaluation**
### Spatial Metrics
- **spatial dispersion (SD):**  measures the spatial blurriness of estimated sources [(ref)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913010069#s0105)
- **Distance of localization error (DLE):** measures the distance between reconstructed and simulated patches [(ref)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913010069#s0105)
- **The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC_{ROC}):** measures the sensitivity and specificity of source detection [(ref)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811905006373#aep-section-id33)
